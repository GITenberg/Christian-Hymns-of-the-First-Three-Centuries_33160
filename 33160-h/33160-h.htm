<h2><i>Christian Hymns of the First Three Centuries</i></h2>
<div id="c1">
<h3>I. Introduction</h3>
<p>There is no part of the general field of Christian hymnology
so baffling to the student or so full of difficulties as the one
under consideration in this paper. Many accounts of the
subject are in existence but are far from conclusive. This is
due, first of all, to the unexpected scarcity of original sources.
When one views the rise of Christianity from its inception to
the period of the Council of Nicaea, 325, its numerical growth
from a handful of original adherents to millions of followers
at the time of the Edict of Milan, 313, its literary development
from early scattered records to the works of the great
Greek and Latin fathers, one cannot help inquiring, &ldquo;What
has become of their hymns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another puzzling aspect of the study is the complex historical
background against which the progress of Christianity
appears. The peace and constructive progress of the Augustan
era, in which Christianity was founded, have often been
cited as factors contributing to its evolution and spread.
But this is not the whole story. The civilization of that day,
especially in the eastern Mediterranean lands most concerned,
was largely Hellenistic, of mingled Greek and oriental
features which were necessarily wrought into the fabric of the
new religion. An understanding of pre-Augustan conditions, in
which these diverse historical and literary trends were merged,
is essential, for without it the subject is unintelligible.</p>
<p>A further problem which confronts the student is that of
interpretation. It is well known that any general treatment
of early Christianity is apt to conform to the point of view of
the author. The study of hymnology, like that of other
features of the early Church, is apt to be affected by the
opinion of the commentator.</p>
<p>It is no wonder that the field has been neglected and that
the accounts of it are vague, incomplete and unsatisfactory.
In fact, the task of re-examining the mass of extant records
of early Christianity and other relevant material, which
might illuminate the subject of hymnology, seems never to
<span class="pb" id="pg_3">[3]</span>
have been undertaken with this purpose in view. It is,
actually, too vast a project for the casual student and certainly
has not been attempted here. Our best accounts of
early Christian hymnody are often subordinated to a general
history of Christian hymns. This is the case with the article,
entitled, Hymnes, by H. Leclercq, in the <i>Dictionnaire D&rsquo; Arch&eacute;ologie
Chr&eacute;tienne et de Liturgie</i>, probably the best short
account in any language, containing a section on the hymnology
of the first three centuries.<sup><a id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></sup>
Charles Stanley Phillips
drew generously from this source for the first chapter of <i>Hymnody,
Past and Present</i>, which is written from the liturgical
standpoint.<sup><a id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></sup>
Independent studies are rare. Among
them, <i>Die Hymnendichtung des fr&uuml;hen Christentums</i> by
Josef Kroll, a distinguished classical philologist, deserves a
much wider circulation and should be translated for the
benefit of English readers.<sup><a id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In view of the dearth of available material in English, it
has seemed timely to approach the whole subject from a new
standpoint. In this study, the extant hymnic sources will
be presented objectively. Groups of hymns will be used to
illustrate the types current in the period. In connection with
them, the related historical and literary influences will be
noted.</p>
<p>Let us abandon at once our contemporary connotation of
the word <i>hymn</i> which is derived ultimately from the hymns
of Ambrose, 340-397, that is, a metrical lyric constructed in
stanzas. In the pre-Ambrosian period Christian hymns
were largely of the psalm type, to be chanted in rhythmic
periods without rhyme. Not only should the word <i>hymn</i> be
conceived in terms of ancient thought, but also the futile
attempt to differentiate among psalms, hymns and canticles
should be avoided. Specialists in liturgical matters testify
to the confusion existing among ancient writers in the use of
these words and to the uncertainty of definition which
results.<sup><a id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></sup>
It is better not to multiply difficulties but to hold
fast to the actual texts which we know were used in Christian
worship.</p>
</div>
<div id="c2">
<h3>II. Old Testament Hymns</h3>
<p>At the threshold of Christianity the student crosses from
the literary environment of the Old Testament into that of
<span class="pb" id="pg_4">[4]</span>
the New. But in actual practice the Hebrew psalms were
never given up, and to this day are treasured in every branch
of the faith. In the early centuries they formed the bulk of
Christian hymnody. References to their use appear throughout
the New Testament and are familiar to all. And, moreover,
the influence of the Hebrew psalms upon the composition
of new hymns is apparent even in the Gospels.</p>
<p>Keeping these important facts in mind regarding the
psalms, the student may pass on to other hymnic sources in
the Old Testament. Many striking lyrical passages in the
Hebrew scriptures, uttered or perhaps repeated in moments
of emotional fervor, were used by later worshippers to
express a similar attitude toward the Divine.<sup><a id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></sup>
Among these may be cited the Songs of Moses,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="tw">I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously (<span class="scripRef">Ex. 15:1-19</span>),</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="tw">Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words
of my mouth (<span class="scripRef">Deut. 32:1-43</span>);</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hannah&rsquo;s Song of Thanksgiving,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="tw">My heart rejoiceth in the Lord (<span class="scripRef">I Sam. 2:1-10</span>);</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>the great hymns in the Book of Isaiah,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="tw">Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts (<span class="scripRef">Isa. 6:3</span>),</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="tw">We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks (<span class="scripRef">Isa. 26:1-21</span>),</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>the second part of which begins,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="tw">With my soul have I desired thee in the night (<span class="scripRef">Isa. 26:9-21</span>);</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Jonah&rsquo;s Song,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="tw">I cried by reason of my affliction unto the Lord (<span class="scripRef">Jonah 2:2-9</span>);</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>the Song of Habbakuk,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="tw">O Lord, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid (<span class="scripRef">Hab. 3:2-19</span>)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The apocryphal addition to the Book of Daniel, known as
the Song of the Three Holy Children, may be considered
with Old Testament lyrics. Comprising sixty-seven verses, it was
added to <span class="scripRef">Daniel 3:23</span>, but, strictly speaking,
its date, author and original language are unknown. It is probable
that it is of Hebrew authorship and belongs to the first
century, B. C. Its use, however, is unquestioned.<sup><a id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></sup>
The first part,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="tw">Blessed art Thou, O Lord of our fathers,</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_5">[5]</div>
<p>is the familiar <i>Benedictus es, Domine</i>; and the second part,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="tw">O all ye works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>is the <i>Benedicite, omnia opera</i>.</p>
<p>The term <i>canticle</i>, mentioned above, has been applied in a
general sense to such lyrics from the Old Testament and
also from the New. &ldquo;In practice,&rdquo; says James Mearns, &ldquo;it
means those Songs of Holy Scripture which have been
selected for ecclesiastical use and are appended to, or
incorporated with, the Psalter or other parts of the Divine
Office.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a></sup>
Both Eastern and Western Churches early made
official use of the Old Testament
canticles,<sup><a id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a></sup>
while the Greek Church elaborated upon them in formal metrical
compositions, called <i>canons</i>, or groups of <i>odes</i> based upon an acrostic
structure, a distinctive feature of Greek hymnody from the
seventh century.<sup><a id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was only natural that the hymnody of the Old Testament
should have exerted a marked influence upon Christian
practice. The Old Testament tradition was very strong.
Familiar phraseology was ready at hand for the composition
of new canticles which were often mere centos from the
Psalms or other portions of the Hebrew scriptures. It
should be recalled that Christianity not only arose in the
Semitic environment but also was for some years localized
chiefly in the oriental sections of the Roman Empire, and that
it was affected by oriental ideas and modes of expression.
Even after Greek and Roman influences were strongly felt,
hymnology retained this traditional Semitic character and
pagan lyrics were held in suspicion.</p>
</div>
<div id="c3">
<h3>III. New Testament Hymns</h3>
<p>The transition, therefore, to the canticles of the New
Testament was easy and perhaps inevitable. The <i>Benedictus</i>,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="tw">Blessed be the Lord God of Israel (<span class="scripRef">Luke 1:68-79</span>),</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>spoken by Zacharias, the <i>Nunc dimittis</i>,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="tw">Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace (<span class="scripRef">Luke 2:29-32</span>),</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>by Simeon, and above all the <i>Magnificat</i>,</p>

<p>The Apostle Paul and other writers of the New Testament,
who quote freely from a variety of sources, have used
fragments of hymns to reinforce their teachings or with a
devotional purpose. One gains from such citations a text
only, or a fragment of text. Singing is not implied. The
apocalyptic vision of the <i>Book of Revelation</i>, however,
contains several magnificent hymns of praise which testify not
alone to the form and content of the early hymn but also to
the practice of worship in song. The praises of the heavenly
host are mirrored in the praises of the congregation upon
earth.<sup><a id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></sup>

<p>From the point of view of the evolution of Christian hymns,
the hymns in the <i>Book of Revelation</i> are perhaps the most
significant in the New Testament because they exhibit
varied elements, from Judaism, from Christianity and from
the mingling of the two.<sup><a id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_8">[8]</div>
<p>It is interesting to re-read the New Testament in the search
for hymns, but one should remember that the field is controversial.
Some commentators would suggest that the
entire 13th chapter of <i>I Corinthians</i> is a hymn, beginning,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="tw">Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels.<sup><a id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A moderate rather than an extreme position, however, upon
the identity of hymn sources in the New Testament seems
more likely to be productive of a genuine appreciation of the
style, subject matter and number of primitive Christian
hymns.</p>
<p>Traces of poetic improvisation, which is so closely allied to
hymnody, must be seriously considered at this point. The
art of improvisation belongs to no one age or country. It
happens that the Greeks had practiced it for centuries and
that illustrations exist from the time of Homer. To the
Hellenized orient it was familiar. &ldquo;The Greeks of Cilicia
and of the region about Antioch and Tarsus,&rdquo; as Dr. George
Dwight Kellogg reminds us, &ldquo;seem to have cultivated the
art and become famous.&rdquo; He also suggests that the &ldquo;gift of
tongues&rdquo; refers to this art and that Paul himself possessed
the poetic talent in no small degree.<sup><a id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a></sup>
It is only natural to
assume that, among the early Christians, certain individuals
would react to the influence of heightened emotion in outbursts
of poetic expression. Passages in the <i>Book of Acts</i>
may refer to the use of such hymns, for example, in the case
of the Gentiles at Caesarea, who &ldquo;speak with tongues and
magnify God&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Acts 10:45-46</span>), or the
Ephesians who &ldquo;spake with tongues, and prophesied&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">Acts 19:6</span>), or perhaps the
disciples on the Day of Pentecost (<span class="scripRef">Acts 2:4</span>).
Irenaeus, a
second century father of the Church and bishop of Lyons,
referring to the scene at Pentecost, mentions the singing of a
hymn on that occasion.<sup><a id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a></sup>
The nature of improvisations is
fugitive. They arise from individual inspiration and, even
if expressed in familiar phrases, are not remembered or
recorded by the singer or hearer. To whatever degree
improvisation played a part in early Christian hymnody, to
that same degree we lack corresponding literary survivals.
Possibly this is one explanation of the dearth of sources
which we now deplore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_9">[9]</div>
<p>On the whole, the hymnic evidence found in the New
Testament points to a predominant Hebrew influence.
Both in the use of psalms and other Old Testament hymns
and in the phraseology of new hymns, the Christians found
themselves more at home in the traditional forms of expression.
Features of style, such as parallelism, uniformity and
the repetition of words or word order, were not necessarily
restricted to Hebrew poetry but might be found in other
oriental sources&mdash;a consideration to which further attention
will be given later.<sup><a id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></sup>
Still we may assume that the influence
of Judaism in form as well as subject matter was supreme.</p>
</div>
<div id="c4">
<h3>IV. Liturgical Hymns</h3>
<p>Christian practice reveals a third type of Hebrew influence,
the liturgical, which brought about the use of the psalms in
public worship, together with other elements familiar in the
synagogue. At the close of a service of this kind, made up of
prayers, readings, psalms and preaching, the eucharist was
celebrated. Early writings, for example, the <i>Apologia</i> of
Justin Martyr, 100?-165,<sup><a id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a></sup>
the <i>Didache</i><sup><a id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></sup>
and the <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i>,<sup><a id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a></sup>
testify to a somewhat fixed type of worship,
which, varying in details, seems to foreshadow the liturgical
models of the fourth century.</p>
<p>Briefly stated, the <i>Didache</i>, or <i>Teaching of the Twelve
Apostles</i>, is a second century treatise, the second part of
which includes a ritual of baptism, fasting and the
eucharist.<sup><a id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a></sup>
A series of eucharistic prayers is here recorded, beginning,
<span title="Eucharistoumen soi, pater h&ecirc;m&ocirc;n" class="g">&Epsilon;&#8016;&chi;&alpha;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&#8166;&mu;&#8051;&nu; &sigma;&omicron;&iota;, &pi;&#8049;&tau;&epsilon;&rho; &#7969;&mu;&#8182;&nu;</span>,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We thank Thee, our Father,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>offered at stages of the communion ritual where we approach
the heart of Christian worship.<sup><a id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a></sup>
At this point, hymn and
prayer origins merge. Many Christians of our own day,
perhaps the majority, regard the true hymn as a prayer
offered in direct address to God. Throughout the history of
Christian hymns the two forms of worship have overlapped
or been identical. Hymn and prayer were also associated
in ancient cults, and the chorus of a Greek drama offers an
<span class="pb" id="pg_10">[10]</span>
illustration of the superb proportions which this act of
worship may assume. Charles Stanley Phillips, who has
recently translated anew the eucharistic prayer of the <i>Didache</i>,
thinks of it as not a true hymn, but a source and model of
hymnody.<sup><a id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a></sup>
Improvised eucharistic prayer was interrupted
by congregational refrains which provided another opportunity
for the evolution of hymns. As a matter of fact, in all
ages, expressions of thanksgiving, attending the celebration
of the eucharist, have inspired many of the finest hymns of
the faith.</p>
<p>The <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i> is a manual in eight books, of
ecclesiastical discipline, doctrine and worship, including the
<i>Didache</i>.<sup><a id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a></sup>
Dating from the fourth or fifth century, more probably the fourth,
it represents the practice of an earlier period well within the
scope of this study and, in the opinion of Brightman, was compiled
in Antioch or its neighborhood.<sup><a id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a></sup>
Since Greek was the prevailing language in the Christian
world of that day, it became the liturgical language of early
Christianity for the first three centuries. Even in Rome
and other large cities of Italy, Greek was used. In Italy,
with these exceptions and in the western provinces, Latin
was employed, finally superseding Greek as the official
language of the Western Church.<sup><a id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>The following hymns appear in the seventh book of the
Apostolic Constitutions:</p>
<p>A morning hymn, <span title="Doxa en hypsistois the&ocirc;" class="g">&Delta;&#8057;&xi;&alpha; &#7952;&nu; &#8017;&psi;&#8055;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&iota;&sigmaf; &theta;&epsilon;&#8183;</span>,

<p class="t0">Now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace;</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_11">[11]</div>
<p>and a prayer at dinner, <span title="Eulog&ecirc;tos ei" class="g">&Epsilon;&#8016;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&eta;&tau;&#8056;&sigmaf; &epsilon;&#7984;</span>,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="tw">Thou art blessed, O Lord, who nourishest me from my youth.<sup><a id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the eighth book of the <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i> and also
in the <i>Liturgy of St. James</i> we have the <i>Tersanctus</i>,
<span title="Hagios, hagios, hagios" class="g">&#7947;&gamma;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;, &#7939;&gamma;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;, &#7939;&gamma;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Holy, holy, holy.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In another part of the same <i>Liturgy</i> the <i>Trisagion</i> appears,
<span title="Ho trisagios hymnos," class="g">&#8009; &tau;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&#8049;&gamma;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf; &#8021;&mu;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,</p>

<p class="t2">Have mercy upon us.<sup><a id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>An evening hymn, <span title="Ph&ocirc;s hilaron" class="g">&Phi;&#8182;&sigmaf; &#7985;&lambda;&alpha;&rho;&#8057;&nu;</span>,
Joyful light, is mentioned
by Basil in the fourth century as very old. It was sung at
vespers in the Eastern Church:<sup><a id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a></sup></p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O gladsome light, O grace</p>
<p class="t0">Of God the Father&rsquo;s face.<sup><a id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Among ancient liturgical hymns the <i>Te deum</i> should be
mentioned. It is attributed to Nicetas, Bishop of Remesiana
in Dacia, and dated from the end of the fourth century. It
appears to be a combination of three distinct parts. The
first thirteen verses, or parts one and two, probably originated
earlier than the fourth century and may have been
inspired by Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage, 200-258, who
wrote in terms almost identical with the phrases of this early
section, used of prophets, apostles and martyrs.<sup><a id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>Biblical sources, especially the canticles, now appear as
liturgical hymns, either in their original form or in an enlarged
version.<sup><a id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a></sup>
The use of canticles, more particularly in their
variations, is of supreme interest to the hymnologist, because
it offers a theory of the origin of Christian hymnody apart
from liturgical interpolations or from the psalms. Clement
of Rome urged the Corinthians to unite in the spirit of praise
as expressed in the seraphic chorus of Isaiah&rsquo;s vision,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts:</p>
<p class="t0">the whole earth is full of his glory,</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_12">[12]</div>
<p>associating it with the praise of the angelic ministrants, &ldquo;ten
thousand times ten thousand,&rdquo; beheld by Daniel
(<span class="scripRef">Dan. 7:10</span>).
The same hymn had been heard in the apocalyptic mysteries of the
<i>Book of Revelation</i>. Very early it was incorporated
in the liturgy of the eucharist, continuing an
ageless form of the praise of God from the old dispensation
into the new.</p>
<p>The evolution of the Great Doxology from the words of
the angelic song,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Glory to God in the highest,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>to the <i>Gloria in excelsis</i> illustrates the expanding thought of
the Church, corresponding to the growth of the Christian
body within the culture of the Roman Empire. Again, the
<i>Gloria</i> illustrates Hellenistic features of poetic style,
bespeaking the oriental influences which had entered into
Greek literature.<sup><a id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a></sup>
Note the repetition of the clauses,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="tw">We praise thee, we bless thee, we worship thee, we glorify thee, we
give thanks to thee for thy great glory,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>of the invocation,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="tw">O Lord God, heavenly King, God the Father almighty,</p>
<p class="tw">O Lord, the only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="tw">O Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>of the relative clause,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="tw">That takest away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us.</p>
<p class="tw">Thou that takest away the sins of the world, receive our prayer.</p>
<p class="tw">Thou that sittest at the right hand of God the Father, have mercy upon us,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>of the pronoun,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="tw">For thou only art holy; thou only art the Lord; thou only, O Christ,
with the Holy Ghost, art most high in the glory of God the Father.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is quite superfluous to analyze further the values of a
poetic form which has helped to make the <i>Gloria</i> one of the
truly magnificent Christian hymns of all ages.<sup><a id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>Postponing for the present a more detailed inquiry into
stylistic origins, we may regard the group of liturgical hymns
here presented as a source collection of the utmost importance.
It reveals not only the continuity of the Old and New
Testament hymnology but also the evolution of worship in
song into the early Christian era. The fact that worship
<span class="pb" id="pg_13">[13]</span>
was chiefly liturgical in this period and hymns were therefore
liturgical appears an inevitable conclusion.</p>
</div>
<div id="c5">
<h3>V. Contemporary Pagan and Heretical Hymns</h3>
<p>Christianity expanded, as we have seen, in the environment
of eastern Mediterranean culture. Its original heritage was
that of Judaism, but within the first century it had entered
upon the conquest of the Gentile world. As that conquest
proceeded and the penetration of new ideas into pagan thought
continued, a corresponding reaction of paganism upon the
new faith took place. With the general aspects of this
phenomenon all are familiar. It is significant here only in
the field of lyrical expression. The period of pagan influence
in the sense of an imprint from Greek and Roman literature
is also the period of impact with pagan heretical ideas derived
either from current philosophies or the practices of mystery
religions.</p>
<p>Once more the chart and compass offered by the direct
extant sources are the best guides through the cross currents
of the literature in our possession. Representative pagan
poetry must be examined, at least of a few general types, in
order to establish what influence, if any, was exerted upon
contemporary Christian hymns.</p>
<p>Regarding the classical influence, <i>per se</i>, a large number of
Greek hymns were in existence when Christianity was founded,<sup><a id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a></sup>
and Roman lyrics were appearing in that very
century. Paul was obviously acquainted with the Hymn of
Cleanthes, a Stoic writer of the third century, B.C., for he
quoted his words on the Areopagus. The original passage
to which Paul refers has been translated as follows:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thee it is meet that mortals should invoke,</p>
<p class="t0">For we Thine offspring are and sole of all</p>
<p class="t0">Created things that live and move on earth</p>
<p class="t0">Receive from Thee the image of the One.<sup><a id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is evident that the Christian hymns embedded in the books
of the New Testament were not constructed after a classical
model of this type. The influence of Old Testament poetry
was too strong, the associations of paganism repellant and,
moreover, the Greek poetry, familiar to the average man of
that day, quite different. The older Greek hymns, such as
the <i>Homeric Hymns</i>, the <i>Odes</i> of Pindar, the choruses of
<span class="pb" id="pg_14">[14]</span>
Greek tragedy, were produced in the Hellenic or pre-Hellenic
ages which had been followed by more than two centuries
of Hellenistic culture. Dr. Edward Delavan Perry, writing
of Hellenistic poetry, said, &ldquo;Other forms of poetry, particularly
the lyric, both the choral and the &lsquo;individual,&rsquo; died
out almost completely.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>There remain, then, only the extant hymns of the mystery
cults. In spite of many references to the use of singing in
connection with these religions, very few specimens of their
hymns actually survive. The mystery religion was a sacramental
religion &ldquo;which stressed the approach to Deity
through rite and liturgy after a severe probation and an oath
pledging to secrecy.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a></sup>
The leading cults were those associated
with Orpheus, the Magna Mater (Cybele) and Attis,
Mithra, Serapis, Isis, Adonis, and especially the Eleusinian
Mysteries, which flourished for twelve centuries, ending with
their extinction by the Christians in 397.<sup><a id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the period under consideration in this study Isis
was honored in all parts of the Graeco-Roman world. An
authentic hymn to Isis appears in the writings of Apuleius
(b. 125), who describes a procession in honor of the goddess
and gives the words of the chorus, closing,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thy divine countenance and most holy deity I shall guard and keep</p>
<p class="t0">forever in the secret place of my heart.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Variants of the Isis cult hymn or hymns have been preserved
in inscriptions; for example, a hymn of some fifty lines from
Cyme in Aeolia,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
I am Isis the sovereign of the whole land.<sup><a id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a></sup>
</div>
</div>
<p>Liturgical survivals of the cult of Mithra are almost unknown.
Franz Cumont, the great student of Mithraism, quotes one hymn
fragment only,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Hail bridegroom, hail thou new light!<sup><a id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He is of the opinion, however, that the Manichaean song
mentioned by Augustine, 354-430, affords some idea of
Mithraic poetry. The song or hymn in question represents
a chief divinity surrounded by twelve minor divinities,
<span class="pb" id="pg_15">[15]</span>
symbolizing the seasons, all clothed with floral
tributes.<sup><a id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a></sup>
Cumont also suggests that hero hymns were in existence, celebrating the
exploits of the gods.<sup><a id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a></sup>
The so-called <i>Liturgy of Mithra</i>, a magic formula not considered by
Cumont, contains hymn fragments, one of which begins,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord, hail, potentate of the water,</p>
<p class="t0">hail, ruler of the earth,</p>
<p class="t0">hail, potentate of the spirit.<sup><a id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hippolytus, a presbyter of Rome who died in 236, in his
<i>Refutation of all Heresies</i>, quotes certain hymns in praise of
Attis:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Whether thou art the race of Saturn or happy Jupiter,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I will hymn Attis, son of Rhea.<sup><a id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here, as in so many cases, our information concerning pagan
hymns is derived from an opponent, a Christian writer and
defender of orthodox religion, but this circumstance in no
way affects the validity of the text.</p>
<p>For the Orphic cult which had the longest period of influence,
we possess what may be termed a hymn book containing
eighty-seven hymns. It has been variously dated
from the third century, B.C., to the fourth or fifth century,
A.D. With a mental reservation as to the relevancy of the
citations, we find that some of these hymns in praise of the
gods are full of dignity, for instance,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Mother of Gods, great nurse of all, draw near,</p>
<p class="t0">Divinely honored, and regard my prayer.<sup><a id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So debatable is the subject of the Orphic hymns, both in
respect to date and usage, that they offer little or no assistance
to the student who is interested in a possible influence upon
Christian hymnology.<sup><a id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sooner or later, one must turn to the land of Egypt, if one
desires a complete picture of early Christian culture. The
<span class="pb" id="pg_16">[16]</span>
mystery of the Egyptian Isis, mentioned above, was one
element in the background of the times, illustrative of the
religious syncretism which had been fostered throughout the
Ptolemaic period. The identification of the Egyptian Thot with the
Greek Hermes is reflected in the Hermetic literature of which the
<i>Poimandres</i> is the oldest known writing.<sup><a id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a></sup>
From this source a hymn of praise is derived:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">By thy blessing my spirit is illumined,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and a thanksgiving hymn,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Holy is God, the Father of all the universe.<sup><a id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Summarizing the Greek influence, both Hellenic and
Graeco-oriental, upon Christian hymnology, it is difficult,
if not impossible, to trace any connection between the classic
Greek hymns or the hymns of mystery cults, and those of
the new faith. If more sources were available, a valid
conclusion might be reached. At present, a tentative conclusion
involves the recognition of the vigorous protest and
revolt against pagan ideas revealed in contemporary prose
writings, in turn evoked by the actual pressure which was
exerted upon Christianity by alien cults. The twentieth
century has produced an impressive literature centered about
the mystery religions and the problem of their influence upon
Christianity; but in the field of hymnology there have been
discovered only the faintest of traces. These are wholly
stylistic. Christian hymns which reveal the characteristics
of the repetition of direct address, or of relative clauses or
predicates, previously mentioned, illustrate poetic forms
which are, in the final analysis, oriental rather than
Greek.<sup><a id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is a satisfaction to the classicist, who is interested in
the history of this subject, that the classical meters, ignored
at this period, were destined to be revived at a later date.
They were used to some extent from the fourth century.
It was reserved for the court poets of the Carolingian circle
of the ninth century to restore the old lyric meters. The
Sapphic meter in its Horatian form not only was a favorite
among medieval Latin hymn writers, but also it has found
an occasional imitator in the course of the centuries even to
modern times.<sup><a id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a></sup></p>
<p>While hymn sources derived from oriental cults are extremely
<span class="pb" id="pg_17">[17]</span>
scanty, those originating in Gnosticism are much
more numerous and suggestive in their relation to Christian
hymnology. Gnosticism is not so much the name of a
particular philosophy or definite system of belief, as it is a
point of view, which sought to harmonize the speculative
achievement of Greek thought with the oriental myths and
with Christian teachings. The philosophical interpretation
of pagan mythology was extended to Hebrew and Christian
tradition. Thus, in accordance with the tenets of Neoplatonism,
the primeval being has produced the universal
mind and, in turn, mind has produced the soul which in contact
with evil phases of matter has lost its original purity.
Therefore, the soul must retrace its steps until it reaches the
final stage of reunion with the origin of all being. It is easy
to understand how a variety of meanings may be read into a
simple statement like the above. It is also easy to understand
that the possibilities of confusion arising in the first
three centuries of Christian history were matters of the
utmost concern to contemporary Christian writers and
dogmatists. The period abounded in heresies and misunderstandings,
to the discussion of which the ablest minds
of the Church were devoted. Quotations from these authors
furnish many of the extant hymns composed by Gnostics,
either within or without the Christian fold. The range of
literary excellence, of spiritual connotation and of intelligibility
of subject matter in the so-called Gnostic hymns is so
wide that it is difficult to evaluate them. To the modern
reader they vary from the mere rigmarole to the genuinely
inspiring hymn.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best known and certainly one of the loftiest
expressions of Gnostic ideas is the <i>Hymn of the Soul</i>, which is
found in the Apocryphal <i>Acts of Thomas</i>. Dating from the
first half of the third century, the <i>Acts of Thomas</i> recounts
the missionary preaching of the Apostle Thomas in India.
While in prison, he chants this hymn, beginning,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When I was an infant child in the palace of my father.<sup><a id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It has no connection with the narrative but relates in allegorical
fashion the return of the soul, which has been awakened
from its preoccupation with earthly matters, to the higher
state of heavenly existence. Here is a theme congenial to
Christian thought and orthodox in its theology when extricated
<span class="pb" id="pg_18">[18]</span>
from the popular concepts of the times.<sup><a id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a></sup>
The actual authorship of the <i>Hymn of the Soul</i>, which is found in the
Syriac version of the <i>Acts</i> alone, is unknown, but it has been
attributed to some disciple of the Syrian Bardesanes, a
Christian Gnostic who lived in the second half of the second
century.<sup><a id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a></sup>
There seems to be no doubt that Bardesanes was
himself influential as a hymn writer and that he was representative
of a group of poets who were beginning to employ
contemporary rhythms set to melodies familiar in daily
secular life.<sup><a id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <i>Acts of Thomas</i> contains a second hymn,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The damsel is the daughter of light,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>a poem of oriental imagery, personifying the divine wisdom
as a bride.<sup><a id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>The apocryphal <i>Acts of John</i>, dating from the middle of
the second century, yields a third hymn, the <i>Hymn of Jesus</i>.
In the Gospel narrative of the last supper, Jesus and his
disciples, before going to the Mount of Olives, sing a hymn
together. It is not identified but is generally believed to be a
part of the <i>Hallel</i> or group of Passover Psalms, 113-118.
The writer of the <i>Acts of John</i> represents Jesus as using a new
hymn which opens,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Glory be to Thee, Father.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It contains a long series of antitheses, as follows:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I would be saved and I would save,</p>
<p class="t0">I would be loosed and I would loose,</p>
<p class="t0">I would be wounded and I would wound,</p>
<p class="t0">I would be borne and I would bear, etc.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The hymn concludes,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A way am I to thee, a wayfarer.<sup><a id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Variants of the <i>Hymn of Jesus</i> are extant, one of which has
been preserved by Augustine, the Hymn of the Priscillianists,
which came to him from a correspondent in Spain.<sup><a id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hippolytus, whose <i>Refutation of all Heresies</i> has been
mentioned in another connection, discusses the Gnostic sect
of the Naasenes. He quotes one of their hymns, beginning,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The world&rsquo;s producing law was Primal Mind,</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_19">[19]</div>
<p>in which Jesus is represented as the guide of mankind to the
attainment of celestial knowledge.<sup><a id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a></sup>
The system of Valentinus, a Gnostic leader, is also discussed
and a psalm of his authorship is quoted:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I behold all things suspended in air by spirit,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>a didactic presentation of Gnostic thought.<sup><a id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a></sup> It is composed
in dactylic meter, affording another illustration of the adoption
of popular rhythms in the hymnology of the heretical
sects. A Gnostic hymn to the Highest God from a third
century Coptic source may be cited:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thou art alone the eternal and</p>
<p class="t0">thou art alone the deep and</p>
<p class="t0">thou art alone the unknowable, etc.<sup><a id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Whatever impression may be created upon the modern
mind by the perusal of Gnostic poetry, its influence was
admitted by contemporary Christians and combatted by
every means in their power. The Gnostic leaders, unhampered
by Hebrew traditions of religious poetry, were
able to make use of popular forms and popular concepts.
They met the trend of the times more than halfway. Heretical
groups of all varieties of opinion were using hymns as a
means of expressing their beliefs and persuading possible
adherents. At the opening of the fourth century, Arius
appeared, the leader of the group whose theology was rejected
at the Council of Nicaea, 325, and whose hymns were met and
overcome by the verses of Ambrose. Such was the influence
of heretical upon orthodox hymnody.</p>
</div>
<div id="c6">
<h3>VI. Early Christian Hymns</h3>
<p>Turning once more to the authentic Christian hymns of
the first three centuries and this time omitting those which
appear in liturgical sources, we observe three distinct linguistic
groups, the Syriac, the Greek and the Latin.</p>
<p>The most familiar of the Syriac hymns were written by
Ephraem Syrus (b. 307), who strove to counteract the influence
of the Gnostic poets, especially that of his countryman,
Bardesanes. Strictly speaking, he belongs to the
first half of the fourth century but should be considered by
the student who is tracing the continuity of this subject.
His hymns are metrical in the sense of having lines with a
<span class="pb" id="pg_20">[20]</span>
fixed number of syllables and strophic divisions. An Easter
hymn opens thus:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Blessed be the Messiah</p>
<p class="t0">Who has given us a hope</p>
<p class="t0">That the dead shall rise again.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A hymn for the Lord&rsquo;s Day begins,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Glory be to the good</p>
<p class="t0">Who hath honoured and exalted</p>
<p class="t0">The first day of the week.<sup><a id="fr_65" href="#fn_65">[65]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is possible that the hymns of Ephraem were influenced
by the Syriac Odes of Solomon, discovered in 1909, which
were produced in the first century. Whether the <i>Odes</i>
themselves are of Gnostic or Christian origin cannot be
definitely asserted but the probability of the latter is strong.
For a full discussion of this most interesting but highly
controversial topic the work of special commentators must be
consulted.<sup><a id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a></sup>
The intrinsic interest of the collection demands
more than a passing comment. <i>Ode VI</i> opens,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="tw">As the hand moves over the harp and the strings speak,</p>
<p class="tw">So speaks in my members the Spirit of the Lord, and I speak by His
love.<sup><a id="fr_67" href="#fn_67">[67]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Ode IX</i>,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Open your ears</p>
<p class="t2">And I will speak to you,</p>
<p class="t0">Give me your souls,</p>
<p class="t2">That I may also give you my soul.<sup><a id="fr_68" href="#fn_68">[68]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Ode XXIX</i>,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The Lord is my hope:</p>
<p class="t0">In Him I shall not be confounded</p>
<p class="t0">For according to His praise He made me,</p>
<p class="t0">And according to His goodness even so He gave unto me.<sup><a id="fr_69" href="#fn_69">[69]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Ode XXXI</i>, in which Jesus speaks,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">6. </span>Come forth, ye that have been afflicted</p>
<p class="t4">and receive joy</p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">7. </span>And possess your souls by grace;</p>
<p class="t4">and take to you immortal life.</p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">8. </span>And they condemned me when I rose up,</p>
<p class="t4">me who had not been condemned.</p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">9. </span>And they divided my spoil</p>
<p class="t4">though nothing was due to them.<sup><a id="fr_70" href="#fn_70">[70]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_21">[21]</div>
<p>Forty-two in number, the <i>Odes</i> reveal a true inspiration,
novel and significant from the religious and the literary
standpoint. They preserve the tradition of the Old Testament
hymns, yet breathe the spiritual life of the new revelation.
Their chief interest lies in the possibility that they
illustrate a valid Christian poetry of a very early date. If
it is true, as the editors suggest, that the <i>Odes</i> emanate from
Antioch,<sup><a id="fr_71" href="#fn_71">[71]</a></sup>
we have further evidence of the spirit of worship
in that city with which early Christian liturgical forms are so
closely associated.</p>
<p>The tradition of Syriac hymnody, of which these illustrations
alone may be given from the early period, did not come
to an end as Christianity moved westward. It was continued
through thirteen centuries and is preserved in the
Nestorian and other branches of the Syrian Christian Church.</p>
<p>Before the main stream of hymnody in the Greek language
is traced, two sources from the second century will serve as an
introduction. The first of these is the <i>Epistle to Diognetus</i>,
by an unknown author, possibly a catechumen of the Pauline
group.<sup><a id="fr_72" href="#fn_72">[72]</a></sup>
It contains four selections, biblical in their phraseology,
the first three of which express the redemptive mission
of the Son of God:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">As a king sends his son who is also a king, so sent He Him,</p>
<p class="t0">He did not regard us with hatred nor thrust us away,</p>
<p class="t0">He, being despised by the people.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The fourth admonishes the Christian to union with the mind
of God,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Let your heart be your wisdom.<sup><a id="fr_73" href="#fn_73">[73]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The second source is a passage from a sermon on <i>The Soul
and Body</i>, written by Melito of Sardis, a bishop and philosopher
who was martyred in 170. The author pictures all
creation aghast at the crucifixion of Jesus, saying,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">What new mystery then is this?</p>
<p class="t0">The Judge is judged and holds his peace;</p>
<p class="t0">The Invisible one is seen and is not ashamed;</p>
<p class="t8">. . .</p>
<p class="t0">The Celestial is laid in the grave, and endureth!</p>
<p class="t0">What new mystery is this?<sup><a id="fr_74" href="#fn_74">[74]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Whether admissible as a hymn or not, this passage blends,
in a most striking way, oriental and Greek elements employed
in the expression of Christian belief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_22">[22]</div>
<p>Authentic Greek hymnody begins with Clement of Alexandria,
170-220. He is the author of a work of instruction
for catechumens, the <i>Paedagogus</i>, to which is appended a
<i>Hymn to Christ the Savior</i>,
<span title="Hymnos tou s&ocirc;t&ecirc;ros Christou" class="g"> &#8029;&mu;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf; &tau;&omicron;&#8166; &sigma;&omega;&tau;&#8134;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf; &Chi;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&#8166;</span>,
beginning, <span title="Stomion p&ocirc;l&ocirc;n" class="g">&Sigma;&tau;&#8057;&mu;&iota;&omicron;&nu; &pi;&#8061;&lambda;&omega;&nu;</span>.
It is a hymn of praise and
thanksgiving on the part of those newly received into the
Church. Christ is addressed in the familiar oriental imagery
of the guide and shepherd, but the theme is rendered in a
poetic style, which, by the use of short lines and the anapest,
heightens the effect of ecstatic devotion.</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Bridle of colts untamed,</p>
<p class="t2">Over our wills presiding;</p>
<p class="t0">Flight of unwandering birds,</p>
<p class="t2">Our flight securely guiding,&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;<sup><a id="fr_75" href="#fn_75">[75]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The modern adaptation of Clement&rsquo;s hymn, <i>Shepherd of
Tender Youth</i>, by Henry M. Dexter, 1846, while preserving
in a measure the spirit of this piece, in no way reproduces
the original. The <span title="Stomion p&ocirc;l&ocirc;n" class="g">&Sigma;&tau;&#8057;&mu;&iota;&omicron;&nu; &pi;&#8061;&lambda;&omega;&nu;</span>
of Clement is representative
of a theme which pervades Christian hymnody
in all ages, the joy and enthusiasm of the initiate or the
admonition and encouragement addressed to the Christian
who stands upon the threshold of a new life. The <i>Odes of
Solomon</i> have been interpreted in these
terms.<sup><a id="fr_76" href="#fn_76">[76]</a></sup>
Again, the theme is preserved in the so-called Amherst papyrus, which
consists of a hymn of twenty-five tripartite lines, a catechism
or liturgy for the newly baptized. Originating in the third century,
it appears in fragmentary form but sufficiently complete to make clear
its language and purport, as illustrated in the following:<sup><a id="fr_77" href="#fn_77">[77]</a></sup></p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">That thou mayest receive life eternal</p>
<p class="t2">Thou hast escaped the hard law of the unjust ...</p>
<p class="t8">. . .</p>
<p class="t0">Seek to live with the saints, seek to receive life,</p>
<p class="t2">Seek to escape the fire.</p>
<p class="t0">Hold the hope that thou hast learnt. The day that</p>
<p class="t2">the master has appointed for thee is known to no man.</p>
<p class="t8">. . .</p>
<p class="t0">Tell the glad tidings unto children saying: the poor</p>
<p class="t2">have received the kingdom, the children are the inheritors.<sup><a id="fr_78" href="#fn_78">[78]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_23">[23]</div>
<p>The Amherst papyrus is a part of the new store of knowledge
from antiquity which has been opened up within recent
years by the discovery and study of papyri. This branch
of archaeology and palaeography has made available new
fields of research in the study of early Christianity hitherto
unfamiliar. In 1920, among the Oxyrhynchus papyri was
discovered a fragment of a Christian hymn. It appears on
the back of a strip which records a grain account of the first
half of the third century. The hymn has a musical setting,
the earliest example of Christian church music extant. The
fragment consists of the conclusion only, so that the length
and subject matter of the hymn as a whole are unknown.
Creation is enjoined to praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
in the form of a doxology. The meter is anapestic and
purely quantitative.<sup><a id="fr_79" href="#fn_79">[79]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <i>Hymn of Thekla</i>, <span title="An&ocirc;then parthenoi" class="g">&#7948;&nu;&omega;&theta;&epsilon;&nu; &pi;&alpha;&rho;&theta;&#8051;&nu;&omicron;&iota;</span>,
appears in the <i>Banquet of the Ten Virgins</i>, a work of Methodius,
Bishop of Olympus and Patara in Lydia, who was martyred
at Chalcis in 312. It is a hymn of twenty-four stanzas
sung by Thekla, each followed by a refrain sung by the
chorus,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="tw">I keep myself pure for Thee, O Bridegroom, and holding a lighted
torch I go to meet
Thee.<sup><a id="fr_80" href="#fn_80">[80]</a></sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Once more, a traditional theme in Christian hymnody is
set forth, familiar from biblical as well as classical connotations
and perpetuated either in the praise of virginity or in
the form of the mystic union of Christ and the Church.</p>
<p>It is customary in presenting the subject of Greek hymn
writers to pass from Clement of Alexandria to Gregory of
Nanzianzus and Synesius of Cyrene, poets of the fourth
century who mark the beginning of a new era beyond the
limits of this study. They are mentioned here only as a
reminder of the long succession of great poets who created
and maintained Greek hymnody throughout the ancient and
medieval centuries.</p>
<p>Contemporary with the development of Greek hymns, the
literature of the Church was moving toward its destination
in Latin culture. As Latin became a liturgical language the
service hymns, already cited, appeared in their Latin form.
Perhaps this is one reason why the production of original
Latin hymns was so long postponed. It was not until the
<span class="pb" id="pg_24">[24]</span>
middle of the fourth century that the hymns of Hilary of
Poitiers, the first Latin hymn writer, appeared. His authentic
hymns are three in number:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Thou who dost exist before time</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>is a hymn of seventy verses in honor of the Trinity,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The Incarnate Word hath deceived thee, (Death)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>an Easter hymn, and</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In the person of the Heavenly Adam,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>a hymn on the theme of the temptation of Jesus.<sup><a id="fr_81" href="#fn_81">[81]</a></sup>
Hilary, like his Greek contemporaries, stands at the beginning of a
new era, but it was Ambrose, and not he, who inaugurated
the tradition of the medieval Latin hymn.</p>
<p>So far no mention has been made of the fact that the early
period of Christian history was characterized by persecution.
As a rule sporadic and intermittent, it was periodically
severe. At all times Christians, if not actually persecuted,
were objects of suspicion to the Roman government. We
owe to the official zeal of Pliny the Younger, who was a
proconsul in Bithynia in 112, our first glimpse of Christian
worship from the point of view of the outsider. In a letter to the
Emperor Trajan on the subject of the Christians, he says that, as a
part of their service at sunrise, they chanted a hymn, antiphonally,
to Christ as a God.<sup><a id="fr_82" href="#fn_82">[82]</a></sup>
Speculation as to the identity of this hymn has never ceased among
students. Leclercq summarizes the theories as follows: It is a morning
hymn later attributed to Hilary. It is the morning hymn of the Greek
liturgy. It is the morning hymn of the <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i>.
It is the Great Doxology.<sup><a id="fr_83" href="#fn_83">[83]</a></sup>
Since they are
all unsatisfactory as identifications, we remain in ignorance on this
point. A recent study of Pliny&rsquo;s letter by Casper J. Kraemer, a
classicist, proposes the translation of the words <i>carmen dicere</i>,
&ldquo;to chant a psalm.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_84" href="#fn_84">[84]</a></sup>
This most interesting
suggestion is in thorough harmony with our knowledge of the
continuity of the use of the psalms in public worship at this time.</p>

<h3>VII. Conclusion</h3>
<p>Reviewing the total pagan influence, both Greek and
Latin, upon Christian hymnody, it must be understood that,
<span class="pb" id="pg_25">[25]</span>
in comparison with Semitic pressure in its wider implication,
as well as the strictly Hebraic, pagan influence was relatively
slight. It was a matter of centuries before the Hebrew
psalms were permitted any rivals whatever in the usage
of worship, except other biblical citations or such poems as
might be produced by unquestioned churchmen. Even these were
sparingly used, for <i>psalmi idiotici</i>, as the novel and
original compositions were called, were forbidden by the
Church and a new hymnody was thus stifled at its very
birth. In a period of confusion marked by the rival use of
hymns on the part of the orthodox and non-orthodox, it was
felt that worship must be safeguarded. Only after the
appearance of the modern vernacular languages in Europe
in the period of the ninth century, when the liturgy had been
set apart in the Latin tongue, was any real freedom permitted
in the composition of new hymns. By that time the clergy
were the poets and Latin their chosen medium of
expression.<sup><a id="fr_85" href="#fn_85">[85]</a></sup></p>
<p>By the time of Ambrose in the fourth century, however,
Greek and oriental elements had long since merged in other
aspects of civilization and, in the course of time, Christian
hymns felt the effect of a universal development. There
was a certain departure from biblical models and an emancipation
from the old poetic forms in favor of the trend toward
accent and rhyme. After all, a new religion had come into
existence which demanded an authentic expression of a
spiritual aspiration beyond that of the Old Testament
models, just as Isaac Watts in the eighteenth century turned
from the tradition of psalmody to an original presentment
of the new revelation in Christ.</p>
<p>Are we to suppose that the Christians in the Mediterranean
world of the first three centuries, representing the
average inhabitant of these lands, had no hymns except those
cited above? Or others like them? If they had, we are
unacquainted with them. It is fair to assume that secular
poetry and music eventually exerted an influence upon
hymnody. At least the beginning of such influence was
apparent in the adoption of popular meters by heretical poets,
as well as by the orthodox.<sup><a id="fr_86" href="#fn_86">[86]</a></sup>
Later, Ambrose perpetuated aspects of popular verse and perhaps music
as well.<sup><a id="fr_87" href="#fn_87">[87]</a></sup>
But there is no evidence at hand to support the assumption of a
<span class="pb" id="pg_26">[26]</span>
popular hymnody enjoyed either in connection with worship
or independently of it.</p>
<p>The problem of music is outside the province of this paper
but is involved in any serious study of hymnology at any
period of its development. Here the student is almost
totally at a loss for manuscript evidence bearing musical
notation from the primitive period. The Oxyrhynchus
hymn is a solitary example.<sup><a id="fr_88" href="#fn_88">[88]</a></sup>
This does not mean that the
subject is altogether obscure. Many statements about
Christian practice, inspired by biblical precedent, are found
in patristic literature. The traditions both of Hebrew
music and of the early Church are well known. It seems
clear that melody only was employed and that it was, for
the most part, unaccompanied. Instrumentation was opposed
and forbidden in public worship of a liturgical
nature.<sup><a id="fr_89" href="#fn_89">[89]</a></sup></p>
<p>No student can leave the consideration of early Christian
hymnology without a sense of defeat. The past cannot be
forced to yield the hidden knowledge of which it is the
custodian. Sources are very scanty, especially in proportion
to other literary remains of early Christianity. Specifically,
there is no collection of hymns in existence which might
correspond to a modern hymnary. On the contrary, isolated
examples or groups appear from place to place and from time
to time in varied forms. But in one respect our evidence is
sure, if not complete. Springing from the culture and the
vicissitudes of the age, Christian hymns of the early Church,
as in every other stage of its development, not only express
the spiritual aspiration of the time but also respond to the
challenge of a new day.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
